<h1>Forward Euler with no CFL condition</h1>

<p>The state of the code as of this commit has only forward Euler timestepping.
It has no CFL condition (so timestep is constant) and also lacks aliasing masking.
I did some runs just to see how the time-per-step varied between the CPU and GPU.</p>

<h1>Adding in anti-aliasing</h1>

<p>Anti-aliasing does increase the runtime:</p>

<h1>Changing from Forward Euler to RK3 timestepping</h1>

<p>The time per step increases by about a factor of 3 (as expected).
The two lines shown below differ by a factor of 3.</p>
